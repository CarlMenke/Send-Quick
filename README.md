## **_Description_**

This is a full CRUD browser-based instant messaging application in React Redux, postgreSQL, Express.js, and Node.js which I coded in 8 days two weeks after being introduced to these languages.

### **_Features_**

Usilizing Socket.io this Application demonstrates many of the same features as the most popular messaging applications.

 - Instant messaging, the message you send will appear on your friends screen with out the need for them to refresh their page.
 - Instant friend Request, When you send a friend request to a friend they will be prompted immediately with a choice to accept or deny that request.
 - Current typing, you will see a bubble if the friend you are messaging is typing.
 - View most recent messages, when viewing all of your contacts you can see the most recent and updated message they have sent to you.
